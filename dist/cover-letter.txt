Hey Carlos,

I'm currently serving as a TA at UCLA Extension’s Coding bootcamp and am looking to take on additional teaching responsibility. 

I have experience leading classroom discussions, guiding inquiry, emphasizing the meta-skills and core concepts of software engineering, and supporting and providing valuable feedback to students in their projects and challenges.

Additionally, I have taught all of the following technologies: 
  
  * Both client & server-side Javascript – including frameworks like React/Native and Angular
  * Scalable, RESTful backends and Node server-side frameworks like Express
  * Data modeling and persistence with SQL/NoSQL db’s like MySQL and Mongo
  * A test-first, CI/CD delivery approach across multiple platforms and devices

I’m reaching out to you today on Angel.co because I'd love the opportunity to share all accumulated knwowledge with Product School’s students.

If this sounds like a good fit, don't hesitate to reach out!

Best,
Tyler Reitz
